# State-Machine-Architectures-Labview-for-Experiment-Automation

For the variety and complexity of sensor characterization experiments, following capabilities and requirements were defined for the flexible program:  
- Automated, employing combination of computer-controlled instruments to perform the desired functions in real time under user programmable protocols
- Extendable and Modular, adoption of test phases, experimental methods, and data analysis techniques
- Provenance-aware:  Ability to track the history of measurements executed over the time as well the recipes
- User friendly, providing the researcher with an intuitive GUI to set, schedule, and execute the autonomous sensing experimentation events 
- Collaborative, allowing results and proposed experiments to be saved and loaded
